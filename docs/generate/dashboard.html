<h2>azureml-examples files referenced in machine-learning docs</h2>
<p>These dashboards show the status of all files from <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples">azureml-examples</a> that are used in our machine learning documentation.</p>
<p>Use the links above for dashboards of each filetype.
In the dashboards, click on the badge or text in the Status column to see the workflow runs.  Click on the file link to open the associated file. (Or right click to open in a new tab.)
</p>
<p>
    <h2><a name="badges"></a>What do the badges mean?</h2>
You'll see these status badges in the dashboards:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Status &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Green <span class="badge green">passing</span></td>
        <td>The last workflow run on the main branch was successful.  But it still could have been a long time ago. Select the badge to see the history of runs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Grey <span class="badge grey">no status</span></td>
        <td>I think this has something to do an absence of runs on main, even though there may be runs on one or more branches.  Treat is the same as failing. Select the badge to see the history.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Red <span class="badge red">failing</span></td>
        <td>The last workflow run failed. Look at the workflow to determine how long it's been failing.  Investigate when the failures are consistent.  A single failure might be due to limited resources or other non-code related issues.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>No badge</td>
        <td>There is no associated workflow for this file. (Or, there's something strange about the name and the way I construct the link failed.  I need to investigate these more.)</td>
    </tr>
</table>
